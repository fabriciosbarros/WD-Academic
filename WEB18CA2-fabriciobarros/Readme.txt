● The context of the web application cannot be based on any material previously submitted to this course or any other (i.e. should be different to your CA1 submission).


General requirements
1. The Site must be usable, intuitive and user-friendly.
2. The Site should have all the standard elements of a WEB 2.0 styled site – header, menu bar, body,
footer with pages for standard menu items like – about, contact us, etc., making the site
responsive with a framework like Bootstrap.
3. Site should be tested so that all links work, there should be no broken images or spelling errors,
and any security or privacy information should be made known to the user (e.g. if you decide to
put password in plain text and not encrypted).
4. The site should function correctly and present a consistent UI in Firefox And Chrome.
5. Site must be tested on a virtual machine (such as XAMPP) and must run in that environment
from a single root folder
6. Anything not implemented in time should be documented in the report e.g. the severity &
priority of the missing work.
Site must use the following the following technologies HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQLite and Bootstrap. To be awarded a distinction mark also use JQuery and/or AJAX (see Page 1-2 below).
8. The folder structure of the website should be as defined in the lectures

Specific requirement
Page 1 (P1): Database Review
1. This page should display a list of some type with a ‘see more’ button
2. The see more button should use AJAX and JQuery to display beside the list more detail on the list
item (or another method/library you know for providing the same functionality)
3. The list should come from an sqlite database table e.g hobbie bikes, then a list of bikes, the review
would provide more detail on the bike, engine size, first manufactured etc.

Page 2 (P2): Article
1. Use the grids to create at least three content areas on this page
2. Create an article about the hobby using CSS to style the pages in a manner that fits the theme of
the hobbie
3. The top part should contain a number of columns with images, or content that links you down
into sections of the article content (internal page links)
4. The middle is the article
5. The bottom should contain a form that allows anyone interested in this hobbie site to sign up to
receive an email. On submit the contents of the form should be stored to a database table called
newsletter.
6. Create a javascript function in an external file that is called from this page. The function should
perform some calculation, change some style, respond to some event that is relevant to the hobby e.g. flip through images of a bike from various angles, calculate fuel consumption given some input values
7. Add a jQuery component to the page that is relevant to the hobby and the content being presented

Page 3 (P3): A report on the design of this website
1. Include any diagrams or screenshots of the application
2. Introduction: Your name, Email and Student ID
3. Goals of site: What hobbie the site is about
4. Features implemented OR Not with a brief explanation of the technology used and how it was
implemented
5. The list of browsers the application was tested against
References: any sites or persons who helped you
7. Future features predicted (e.g., if you had another six months to work on this, what else would
you do with it?) 8. Reflection:
a. What did you learn from building this web application
b. What would you do differently if you had to build it again
c. What did you find most difficult to implement or understand d. What do you wish you could have implemented
